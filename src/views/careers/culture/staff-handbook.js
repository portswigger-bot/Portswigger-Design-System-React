                        works for your team and the people you work with. For
                        example, some people prefer to start later to
                        accommodate the school run. We don&apos;t impose hard
                        and fast rules, because arrangements that work for some
                        teams might not work for others. If you would like
                        additional flexibility, please discuss this with your
                        team leader.

                        might have different preferences on start and end times.
                        When a new person joins a team, be aware that they
                        won&apos;t automatically have the same routine as the
                        rest of you.

                        Our default place of work is in the office. Whether

                        believe that working together in person fosters the best
                        collaboration, creativity, and problem solving. While we
                        support occasional remote working when needed, we
                        encourage teams to make the most of our vibrant office

                        We are flexible in supporting people in working
                        elsewhere from time to time as the need arises. Examples
                        of this would include staying at home to let in a
                        plumber, receive a delivery, or look after a sick child
                        at short notice. It is hard to codify rules for every
                        situation and we prefer to trust people to do the right
                        thing for their team and for PortSwigger. If in doubt
                        about any planned working arrangements, please speak to
                        your team leader.

                        We firmly believe that culture is about beliefs, values,

                        Swiggers are organized into small teams, generally up to
                        around 10 in size. Within each team, things are fairly
                        flat and self-organized. There is a designated team
                        leader, whose role is to support the rest of the team
                        and to act as the default go-between for other teams.
                        But we view leadership as shared and contextual.

                        There is hardly anything that any of us are working on

                        having people overhear office conversations is a good
                        thing, as it often helps people to see off a
