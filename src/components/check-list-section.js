                        fun. They generally come down to bad culture:
                        disrespect, hoarding information and assets,
                        command-and-control management, selfishness,
                        organizational politics, lack of integrity,
                        dysfunctional backstabbers, over-promoted
                        under-performers. Our culture is the antidote to all
                        these things.
